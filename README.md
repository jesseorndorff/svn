Hey Jason,

I would love an opportunity to chat with you about the new product designer position you have open at Basecamp. I know how rare a design job is at Basecamp, so I spent some time thinking of what was the best way to show you I am a good fit. 

I wanted to show you all the cool design stuff I have been doing for the last few years. Then I thought I would show you some awesome examples of my front-end coding skills. But I realized, if I was hiring someone, I would care more about who they are and if they would fit the culture. So this is who I am.

I am a web designer from Seattle, but now live in Cambodia with my wife. 

Why Cambodia? A few years ago my wife and I learned about human trafficking. We wanted to help. So three years ago we dropped everything and moved to Phnom Penh. My wife works for a social enterprise that provides former sex workers jobs and opportunities to learn new skills. And I opened a small studio space where Cambodians can come to learn design and write code.

We love what we do. I know you do too (I've read your books).

I've spent the last 4 years working for an agency based in Seattle called <a href="http://www.cobalt.com/">Cobalt</a>. They provide marketing services to the auto industry. Mostly large brands like GM, Volkswagen, and Hyundai. I started my time there as an ad designer and developer. Most of my time was focused on designing flash ads and developing them in Action Script. Since I have been at Cobalt my role has grown. Now I am responsible for managing and designing new product rollouts for the Australian auto brand Holden.

I've spent a lot of time working on optimizing landing page designs. I've learned a ton. Cobalt has been an amazing company to work for. They embraced our decision to move abroad. They have allowed me room to grow into my role. And they have provided me opportunity to work on some really cool projects.

In my spare time I help NGOs like <a href="http://www.splash.org">Splash</a> and <a href="http://www.hagarinternational.org">Hagar</a> with their design, development and marketing needs. I teach HTML/CSS to Cambodians and <a href="http://www.phnompenhpost.com/columns/finding-technological-solutions-society%E2%80%99s-toughest-challenges">I speak at Cambodian tech conferences</a>. I love the tech community in Cambodia and I am proud to be able to invest in it.

I have a few side projects too. I designed and launched an iOS app to find good food in Phnom Penh and I work on my open source CMS: Halogy. 

In addition to all that stuff, I love to be curious. I love to learn more about the world around me. I am always interested in learning about new technologies, design trends, or how to hand roast a great batch of coffee.

I still have a lot to learn and I feel like my best work is still ahead of me. I would love a chance to chat more about the design role. If you have some time, please take a look at my personal site, which has samples of my design work: <a href="http://www.jesseorndorff.com">www.jesseorndorff.com</a>

Jesse Orndorff
